title: "DeKCD - Major Data Management platforms - Draft"
---

## Progress

* TODO: Analysis of combinability, transferability to other domains and their adaptability to cloud architectures.
The first step is to complete a dry list of solution with their adaptability to cloud architecture (mostly if they have a containerization set-up).

* Missing: pharmaceutical, urbanism, astronomy (seems to be online catalogues and desktop tools mostly), controlled vocabulary (most listed [here](https://github.com/gbv/bartoc.org/wiki/Software-for-controlled-vocabularies))

* Incomplete: geomatics

## Process

Top-Down approach: first listing with technical information (online, containers, ...), then API support. Finally interoperability (data format of API), possibility of transfer to other domains and adaptability to cloud.
Major platforms are easy-to-find and popular platforms.
Draft should be in to_sort or to_investigate pages.

## To Work-On

* Write about non-software dedicated DM approach (for instance semantic-web, RDF or Apache Spark).

* Better presentation, without making editing more complex

* How to present transferability

## Others

* [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

NextCloud is a file hosting service, similar to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, but OpenSource that can be self-hosted. It is a free file hosting platform, it does not constraint which data are stored and do not follow complex metadata or formats. It can be extended and adapted using plugin, such as a plugin to integrate an office suite, such as LibreOffice.
As such, it should be considered a support application before all: a tool to support your work, or a way to store data for other applications. The absence of constraint makes it a poor choice for FAIR data storage, as the users would need to do most of the needed work. Still, interconnected via API to other Software, it could be an essential part of a Data Management solution, even if only as a scrapbook.
NextCloud has an extensive API, so could be used with constraint via the API using a dedicated Pipeline. It could be with connection with another application or for a specific use-case.
