NextCloud is a file hosting service, similar to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive, but OpenSource that can be self-hosted. It is a free file hosting platform, it does not constraint which data are stored and do not follow complex metadata or formats. It can be extended and adapted using plugin, such as a plugin to integrate an office suite, such as LibreOffice.
As such, it should be considered a support application before all: a tool to support your work, or a way to store data for other applications. The absence of constraint makes it a poor choice for FAIR data storage, as the users would need to do most of the needed work.
NextCloud has an extensive API, so could be used with constraint via the API using a dedicated Pipeline. It could be with connection with another application or for a specific use-case.
