It is a free file hosting platform, it does not constraint which data are stored and do not follow complex metadata or formats. It can be extended and adapted using plugin, such as a plugin to integrate an office suite, such as LibreOffice. As such, it should be considered a support application before all: a tool to support your work, or a way to store data for other applications. The absence of constraint makes it a poor choice for FAIR data storage, as the users would need to do most of the needed work. Still, interconnected via API to other Software, it could be an essential part of a Data Management solution, even if only as a scrapbook. NextCloud has an extensive API, so could be used with constraint via the API using a dedicated Pipeline. It could be with connection with another application or for a specific use-case.\nHelm chart",

They often support standard data formats, meta-data formats, sometimes follow a standard schema, such as ISA (Investigations, Studies, Assays), and might support standard Ontologies, such as those listed on OLS.\nThe word “standard” is not repeated by mistake, a good data-management platform should deal mostly with standard formats, so that nothing is new or unknown for an external user. However, it does not mean that the software is only dealing with standard data format, but there should be a clear way to get the format following a standard.\nAn in-depth description of data-management is presented on RDM Kit, and most training material are listed on TESS"
